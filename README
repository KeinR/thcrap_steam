Quick setup:
1. Download thcrap_steam.py and put it somewhere like ~/scripts/ or ~/
2. Put this line in the custom launch options for the game:
/usr/bin/python3 <SCRIPT> "%command%"
Where <SCRIPT> is the path to thcrap_steam.py
3. Download thcrap_steam.ini.def and move it to ~/.config
also rename it to thcrap_steam.ini and make sure that the variables are what
you want
thcrap -> path to thcrap (default = ~/thcrap)
patch -> the patch to use (default = en.js)
log -> logfile (default = ~/thcrap_steam.log)
4. You're done! When you click 'play', the game should now launch the game with thcrap, with your desired patch configuration.

Explanation:

Script for executing a touhou game on Linux with thcrap that was installed through steam.
....That was a mouthful.
Through extensive tinkering with the custom launch options, I discovered a few things.
One of which was that I have no idea how precisely they are evaluating the commands.
One particularly annoying thing is that it apparently prohibited text substitution or something.
Or something, I'm not terribly sure...
I tried to find a one liner, but that didn't happen.
But what I did find out is that it allowed you to invoke another process and delegate to that.
So, say, call python and modify the command that steam would execute.

The command that steam uses to invoke a touhou game (and I assume it's the same for other games) is something like:

'$HOME/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/$STEAMRUNTIME_v2-entry-point --verb=waitforexitandrun -- '$HOME/.steam/<...>/steamapps/common/Proton $PROTONVERSION'/proton waitforexitandrun  '$HOME/.steam/<...>/steamapps/common/thXX/thXX.exe'

(Note that the $'d variables, with the exception of perhaps $HOME, don't actually exist)

This is the actual command that steam runs to start up the game.
So, with that, you can swap out the game executable with thcrap - and Steam isn't the wiser!

The code is terrible, but you should look there for more information (it's only like 60 loc)
